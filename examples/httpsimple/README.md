# HTTP simple

## Intro

The following examples illustrate how to respond and request with HTTP

### Responding

Open two shells and run

```sh
# shell 1
# Listen for TCP connection on port 8080.
# -l = listen
# -k = do not close when client closes connection
nc -kl 8080

# shell 2
# Send an HTTP request to localhost:8080
curl localhost:8080
```

The outcome is as follows:

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
User-Agent: curl/8.7.1
Accept: */*

```

Now respond with

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-length: 11

i like http

```

Congrats ðŸŽ‰ you manually responded to an HTTP request via a TCP connection.

### Requesting

Lookup the IP of you favoruite webpage via
[DNS lookup](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/#A/) and establish a TCP
connection on port 80

```sh
# e.g. www.google.com has 64.233.164.103
nc 64.233.164.103 80
```

and enter

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
host: www.google.com

```

This returns something like

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Expires: -1
Cache-Control: private, max-age=0
Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1
